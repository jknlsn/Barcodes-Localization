# Barcodes Localization

If you want to help me translate Barcodes for iOS, a digital wallet that lets you scan and store barcodes of loyalty cards or gym tags, please get in touch! I'm [@jknlsn](https://twitter.com/jknlsn) on Twitter, or email me at [jake@barcodesapp.com](mailto:jake@barcodesapp.com).

If you don't see your language listed already, then please let me know. Alternatively, copy the en.lproj folder, rename to your language id designator from this [site](https://www.ibabbleon.com/iOS-Language-Codes-ISO-639.html), i.e. uk.lproj or it.lproj, and go from there!
