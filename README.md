# Barcodes Localization

If you want to help me translate Barcodes for iOS, a digital wallet that lets you scan and store barcodes of loyalty cards or gym tags, please get in touch! I'm [@jknlsn](https://twitter.com/jknlsn) on Twitter, or email me at [jake@barcodesapp.com](mailto:jake@barcodesapp.com).

If you don't see your language listed already, then please let me know.
